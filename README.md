A Discord integration for Hypixel SkyBlock, developed with love and passion.

To configure it, run ``/skyblockrpc``.

### Features

- Various elements to showcase either your profile or other information.
- Rotating elements when selecting multiple elements per line.

### Mod Compatibility

#### SkyBlocker

- **Issue**: [SkyBlocker](https://github.com/SkyblockerMod/Skyblocker) includes its own discord rpc.
- **Note**: It's not really an issue, you may just have both on your profile if you don't deactivate it.
